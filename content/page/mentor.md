I :joy_cat: am always passionate about talking / mentoring / working with junior self-motivated students. I prefer writing detailed documents so that team members can discuss the technical details more easily. 
<!-- I'm a hands-on senior postdoc: I'd like to give very concrete suggestions and have frequent (can be short) 1-1 meetings with junior student.  -->


Drop me an email if you want to have a chat. 

I feel honored to be able to work, and grow together, with many young students with unlimited talent. 
Here is a list of students that I am co-mentoring or co-mentored with other senior researchers:
